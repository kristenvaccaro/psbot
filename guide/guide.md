# General advice for conversation(s)

## Lots of people in the queue?

The updates on the numbers of users in the queue are meant to help you see how many users are online. If there is more than 1 person waiting and you are the only stylist online, try to wrap up your conversation somewhat quickly so you can help someone else. 

## Solicit better responses from your user by asking them background questions like:

* Where are you going?
* Are you in school?
* What kinds of events do you typically attend?
* What is your workplace dress code?
* What is the weather going to be like?
* What kinds of dresses do you typically like best? 
* What colors do you generally prefer?

## Use background information to offer general ideas like:

* These shoes would go well with a dress for a concert
* Here are some floral patterns that work well with the color yellow
* Here are some dresses that are good for an autumn wedding

## Send images to give users a better idea of what they are looking for...
