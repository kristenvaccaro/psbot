# Welcome To PSBot : The Personal Stylist Bot - A Research Prototype

## Personal Stylist Tutorial on Using Personal Style Bot:

### 1) Sign up/ Log into Messenger for Facebook:

https://www.messenger.com/

### 2) Find the bot on Messenger:

https://www.messenger.com/t/personalstylebot

### 3) Log in as a fashion stylist:

Once you have the PSBot chat open, type in and send the message "style247" or "Style247" or "STYLE247" in the chat to get an option to log in as a stylist.

Click on the button to successfully log in as a fashion stylist

Great! Now you are a registered personal stylist. If you receive a message from a user you will have the opportunity to claim or delete a potential conversation. You will now be visible to the user as "PSBot", and not as yourself (More about this in the general advice section).

### 4) Claim a user to begin a conversation:

When users message the bot, you will receive their initial queries accompanied by a "CLAIM USER" button and a "DELETE USER" button.

Click on the "CLAIM USER" button to engage with a user.

(more on the "DELETE USER" button in the general advice section)

### 5) End a conversation: If the user:

* Hasn’t been responding for 20 minutes OR
* Responds only every 10 minutes OR
* There are a lot of users in the queue (See general advice section)

Then ask them “Is there anything else I can help you with?” If no response in 5-10 minutes, then tell them to check back in another time and sign off with current conversation.

To sign off, type in the message "menu" or "Menu" or "MENU".

You will receive the following option button to end the conversation.

![End Conversation Button Image](https://github.com/datadrivendesign/fashion.woz_chatbot/blob/dev/guide/images/EndConvo.png)

You have now successfully stopped and saved the conversation.

***It is important that you end a conversation once you are done talking with a user. If you do not, you will not be able to connect with other users, until you do end the current conversation***

You can now continue to claim other users in the queue to give style advice, and when you are ready you can log off as a stylist. 

### 6) Log off as a fashion stylist:

Type in the message "menu" or "Menu" or "MENU".

You will receive the following option button to sign off as a stylist.

You have now successfully logged off as a personal fashion stylist. To log back in follow Step 3.

## General advice for conversation(s)

### Lots of people in the queue? 

![Update Message Image](https://github.com/datadrivendesign/fashion.woz_chatbot/blob/dev/guide/images/queue.png)

The updates on the numbers of users in the queue are meant to help you see how many users are online. If there is more than 1 person waiting and you are the only stylist online, try to wrap up your conversation somewhat quickly so you can help someone else. 

Occasionally you will have some users return to say "thank you", "bye", etc., only in such a situation should you use the "DELETE USER" button, so that you can spend more of your time helping other users.

### Solicit better responses from your user by asking them background questions like:

* Where are you going?
* Are you in school?
* What kinds of events do you typically attend?
* What is your workplace dress code?
* What is the weather going to be like?
* What kinds of dresses do you typically like best? 
* What colors do you generally prefer?

### Use background information to offer general ideas like:

* These shoes would go well with a dress for a concert
* Here are some floral patterns that work well with the color yellow
* Here are some dresses that are good for an autumn wedding

### Send images to give users a better idea of what they are looking for...

### Are you a human or a bot?

When curious users ask if they are interacting with a human or a bot, alternate your responses between "You are talking to a bot" and "You are talking to a human".

To the those users that you reveal yourself to as a human or just in general to any and all users, do not give out your personal information. When asked for any personal information like your name, number, gender, age, etc., respond by saying "My name is PSBot".
